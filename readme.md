Reddit Sentiment Analysis Using NLP & Deep Learning

Overview

This project aims to analyze Reddit comments from various subreddits using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We extract insights from the text using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings, and train a sentiment classification model using BERT. The dataset consists of real Reddit comments from various topics, making it ideal for analyzing sentiment trends and user engagement.

Project Goals

Explore and visualize text data from Reddit comments.

Perform sentiment analysis using VADER and classify comments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

Implement TF-IDF to determine the most important words in comments.

Use Word2Vec embeddings to understand word relationships and visualize them using t-SNE.

Leverage BERT embeddings to capture deep contextual meaning and visualize them using PCA.

Train a BERT-based sentiment classifier for automatic sentiment prediction.
